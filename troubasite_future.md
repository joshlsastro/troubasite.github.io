# The Troubafuture of the Troubasite

Hello. It's the Troubasite maintainer. Since I will be leaving Troubadours this year, the future of the Troubasite is somewhat uncertain. If no one becomes the maintainer next year, the Troubasite will go down on Saturday, May 25. It will be archived at [https://joshlsastro.github.io/troubasite](//joshlsastro.github.io/troubasite). If you're interested in taking over, please read below. 

# How to Take Over the ~~World~~ Troubasite

You need the following to maintain the Troubasite:  
* A desktop computer or laptop
* You must be able to use Markdown. If you can't, it is very easy to learn, like Google Docs easy to learn. 
* You need to be willing to use your email as the one for the Troubasite GitHub account (GitHub does not send spam). 

## Markdown

Markdown is plain text with some bells and whistles attached to make it suitable for writing Web pages. For instance, you can have *italic*, **bold**, or ~~struck through~~ text. It also supports [links](declaration_of_independence.md) and images:

In fact, what you're reading *right now* is in Markdown. You can find the Markdown for this page [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/troubasite/troubasite.github.io/master/troubasite_future.md). Here's some resources for learning Markdown:

* [Interactive tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/)
* [Exhaustive Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)


## Help

I should be able to help you with the site, especially early in the year. GitHub is built for collaboration, so I can help fix something if you mess it up. 

# Goodbye

Troubadours has been a lot of fun. I wish you guys the best of luck. 

Be curious!
