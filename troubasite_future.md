# The Troubafuture of the Troubasite

**Update: I found a feature over the summer known as GitHub Organizations. It should allow me to work with someone else on the website in a similar fashion to Google Docs. If you're interested in seeing this website become active again, please contact me.**

Hello. It's the Troubasite maintainer. Since I will be leaving Troubadours this year, the future of the Troubasite is ~~somewhat~~ completely uncertain. If you're interested in helping out, please read below.

# How to Take Over the ~~World~~ Troubasite

You need the following to maintain the Troubasite:  
* A desktop computer or laptop
* You must be able to use Markdown. If you can't, it is very easy to learn, like Google Docs easy to learn.
* You will need a GitHub account. Signing up is free.

## Markdown

Markdown is plain text with some bells and whistles attached to make it suitable for writing Web pages. For instance, you can have *italic*, **bold**, or ~~struck through~~ text. It also supports [links](declaration_of_independence.md) and images:

In fact, what you're reading *right now* is in Markdown. You can find the Markdown for this page [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/troubasite/troubasite.github.io/master/troubasite_future.md). Here's some resources for learning Markdown:

* [Small Cheatsheet with interactive tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help)
* [Exhaustive Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)


## Help

I should be able to help you with the site, especially early in the year. GitHub is built for collaboration, so I can help fix something if you mess it up.

# Goodbye

Troubadours has been a lot of fun. I wish you guys the best of luck.

Be curious!
